## Hi there ðŸ‘‹


I'm currently a Senior Principal Scientist and Group Leader in the gRED Computational Sciences Hub at Genentech.
My group focuses on developing robust and modular software tools for implementing computational methods applied to large genomics data. 

Before joining Genentech in 2017, I first got my PhD degree in Biostatistics at Johns Hopkins University under the supervision of [Dr. Kasper Hansen](https://www.hansenlab.org), and then pursued a postdoctoral degree in Neuroinformatics at the University of Pennsylvania with [Dr. Taki Shinohara](https://www.dbeicoe.med.upenn.edu/pennsive).
